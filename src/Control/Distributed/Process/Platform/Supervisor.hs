--
-- This module implements a process which supervises a set of other
-- processes, referred to as its children. These /child processes/ can be
-- either workers (i.e., processes that do something useful in your application)
-- or other supervisors. In this way, supervisors may be used to build a
-- hierarchical process structure called a supervision tree, which provides
-- a convenient structure for building fault tolerant software.
--
-- Unless otherwise stated, all functions in this module will cause the calling
-- process to exit unless the specified supervisor process exists.
--
-- [Supervision Principles]
--
-- A supervisor is responsible for starting, stopping and monitoring its child
-- processes so as to keep them alive by restarting them when necessary.
--
-- The supervisors children are defined as a list of child specifications
-- (see 'ChildSpec'). When a supervisor is started, its children are started
-- in left-to-right (insertion order) according to this list. When a supervisor
-- stops (or exits for any reason), it will terminate its children in reverse
-- (i.e., from right-to-left of insertion) order. Child specs can be added to
-- the supervisor after it has started, either on the left or right of the
-- existing list of children.
--
-- When the supervisor spawns its child processes, they are always linked to
-- their parent (i.e., the supervisor), therefore even if the supervisor is
-- terminated abruptly by an asynchronous exception, the children will still be
-- taken down with it, though somewhat less ceremoniously in that case.
--
-- [Restart Strategies]
--
-- Supervisors are initialised with a 'RestartStrategy', which describes how
-- the supervisor should respond to a child that exits and should be restarted
-- (see below for the rules governing child restart eligibility). Each restart
-- strategy comprises a 'RestartMode' and 'RestartLimit', which govern how
-- the restart should be handled, and the point at which the supervisor
-- should give up and terminate itself respectively.
--
-- With the exception of the @RestartOne@ strategy, which indicates that the
-- supervisor will restart /only/ the one individual failing child, each
-- strategy describes a way to select the set of children that should be
-- restarted if /any/ child fails. The @RestartAll@ strategy, as its name
-- suggests, selects /all/ children, whilst the @RestartLeft@ and @RestartRight@
-- strategies select /all/ children to the left or right of the failed child,
-- in insertion (i.e., startup) order.
--
-- Note that a /branch/ restart will only occur if the child that exited is
-- meant to be restarted. Since @Temporary@ children are never restarted and
-- @Transient@ children are /not/ restarted if they exit normally, in both these
-- circumstances we leave the remaining supervised children alone. Otherwise,
-- the failing child is /always/ included in the /branch/ to be restarted.
--
-- For a hypothetical set of children @a@ through @d@, the following pseudocode
-- demonstrates how the restart strategies work.
--
-- > let children = [a..d]
-- > let failure = c
-- > restartsFor RestartOne   children failure = [c]
-- > restartsFor RestartAll   children failure = [a,b,c,d]
-- > restartsFor RestartLeft  children failure = [a,b,c]
-- > restartsFor RestartRight children failure = [c,d]
--
-- [Branch Restarts]
--
-- We refer to a restart (strategy) that involves a set of children as a
-- /branch restart/ from now on. The behaviour of branch restarts can be further
-- refined by the 'RestartMode' with which a 'RestartStrategy' is parameterised.
-- The @RestartEach@ mode treats each child sequentially, first stopping the
-- respective child process and then restarting it. Each child is stopped and
-- started fully before moving on to the next, as the following imaginary
-- example demonstrates for children @[a,b,c]@:
--
-- > stop  a
-- > start a
-- > stop  b
-- > start b
-- > stop  c
-- > start c
--
-- By contrast, @RestartInOrder@ will first run through the selected list of
-- children, stopping them. Then, once all the children have been stopped, it
-- will make a second pass, to handle (re)starting them. No child is started
-- until all children have been stopped, as the following imaginary example
-- demonstrates:
--
-- > stop  a
-- > stop  b
-- > stop  c
-- > start a
-- > start b
-- > start c
--
-- Both the previous examples have shown children being stopped and started
-- from left to right, but that is up to the user. The 'RestartMode' data
-- type's constructors take a 'RestartOrder', which determines whether the
-- selected children will be processed from @LeftToRight@ or @RightToLeft@.
--
-- Sometimes it is desireable to stop children in one order and start them
-- in the opposite. This is typically the case when children are in some
-- way dependent on one another, such that restarting them in the wrong order
-- might cause the system to misbehave. For this scenarios, there is another
-- 'RestartMode' that will shut children down in the given order, but then
-- restarts them in the reverse. Using @RestartRevOrder@ mode, if we have
-- children @[a,b,c]@ such that @b@ depends on @a@ and @c@ on @b@, we can stop
-- them in the reverse of their startup order, but restart them the other way
-- around like so:
--
-- > RestartRevOrder RightToLeft
--
-- The effect will be thus:
--
-- > stop  c
-- > stop  b
-- > stop  a
-- > start a
-- > start b
-- > start c
--
-- [Restart Intensity Limits]
--
-- If a child process repeatedly crashes during (or shortly after) starting,
-- it is possible for the supervisor to get stuck in an endless loop of
-- restarts. In order prevent this, each restart strategy is parameterised
-- with a 'RestartLimit' that caps the number of restarts allowed within a
-- specific time period. If the supervisor exceeds this limit, it will stop,
-- terminating all its children (in left-to-right order) and exit with the
-- reason @ExitOther "ReachedMaxRestartIntensity"@.
--
-- The 'MaxRestarts' type is a positive integer, and together with a specified
-- @TimeInterval@ forms the 'RestartLimit' to which the supervisor will adhere.
-- Since a great many children can be restarted in close succession when
-- a /branch restart/ occurs (as a result of @RestartAll@, @RestartLeft@ or
-- @RestartRight@ being triggered), the supervisor will track the operation
-- as a single restart attempt, since otherwise it would likely exceed its
-- maximum restart intensity too quickly.
--
-- [Child Restart and Termination Policies]
--
-- When the supervisor detects that a child has died, the 'RestartPolicy'
-- configured in the child specification is used to determin what to do. If
-- the this is set to @Permanent@, then the child is always restarted.
-- If it is @Temporary@, then the child is never restarted and the child
-- specification is removed from the supervisor. A @Transient@ child will
-- be restarted only if it terminates /abnormally/, otherwise it is left
-- inactive (but its specification is left in place). Finally, an @Intrinsic@
-- child is treated like a @Transient@ one, except that if /this/ kind of child
-- exits /normally/, then the supervisor will also exit normally.
--
-- When the supervisor does terminate a child, the 'ChildTerminationPolicy'
-- provided with the 'ChildSpec' determines how the supervisor should go
-- about doing so. If this is @TerminateImmediately@, then the child will
-- be killed without further notice, which means the child will /not/ have
-- an opportunity to clean up any internal state and/or release any held
-- resources. If the policy is @TerminateTimeout delay@ however, the child
-- will be sent an /exit signal/ instead, i.e., the supervisor will cause
-- the child to exit via @exit childPid ExitShutdown@, and then will wait
-- until the given @delay@ for the child to exit normally. If this does not
-- happen within the given delay, the supervisor will revert to the more
-- aggressive @TerminateImmediately@ policy and try again. Any errors that
-- occur during a timed-out shutdown will be logged, however exit reasons
-- resulting from @TerminateImmediately@ are ignored.
--
-- [Creating Child Specs]
--
-- The 'ToChildStart' typeclass simplifies the process of defining a 'ChildStart'
-- providing three default instances from which a 'ChildStart' datum can be
-- generated. The first, takes a @Closure (Process ())@, where the enclosed
-- action (in the @Process@ monad) is the actual (long running) code that we
-- wish to supervise. In the case of a /managed process/, this is usually the
-- server loop, constructed by evaluating some variant of @ManagedProcess.serve@.
--
-- The other two instances provide a means for starting children without having
-- to provide a @Closure@. Both instances wrap the supplied @Process@ action in
-- some necessary boilerplate code, which handles spawning a new process and
-- communicating its @ProcessId@ to the supervisor. The instance for
-- @Addressable a => SupervisorPid -> Process a@ is special however, since this
-- API is intended for uses where the typical interactions with a process take
-- place via an opaque handle, for which an instance of the @Addressable@
-- typeclass is provided. This latter approach requires the expression which is
-- responsible for yielding the @Addressable@ handle to handling linking the
-- target process with the supervisor, since we have delegated responsibility
-- for spawning the new process and cannot perform the link oepration ourselves.
--
-- [Supervision Trees & Supervisor Termination]
--
-- To create a supervision tree, one simply adds supervisors below one another
-- as children, setting the @childType@ field of their 'ChildSpec' to
-- @Supervisor@ instead of @Worker@. Supervision tree can be arbitrarilly
-- deep, and it is for this reason that we recommend giving a @Supervisor@ child
-- an arbitrary length of time to stop, by setting the delay to @Infinity@
-- or a very large @TimeInterval@.
